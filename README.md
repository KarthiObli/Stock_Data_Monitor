The project Stock Data Monitor focuses on building a automated data pipeline which handles end-to-end processing and visualization of 5 stocks data over a period of 12 months. The flow begins with collecting historical stock data for last 12 months in an excel file. The data in the excel is uploaded into postgres tables. End to end data pipeline is build using data potgres. Series of tranformation code is written as stored procedure. So by triggering the different stored different transformation code is triggered. Once the transformation is complete, the processed data is visualized through an Power BI dashboard, enabling insightful analysis of stock trends and performance. Apache Airflow is integrated to schedule and trigger the PostgreSQL data pipeline code. This eliminates manual intervention and ensures that the dashboard reflects the latest available data.
